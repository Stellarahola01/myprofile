  	<h2>Passions</h2>
    <p>
    	I am passionate about a lot of things in my life. I love the island I was born and raised in (Ibiza). I enjoy susets, walks around the beach, nightlife and most importantly the calm and careless lifestyle that this place has to offer. Looking into more personal passions, I adore history, art  and a good book read. I love to travel and discover other cultures to broaden my horizons. Fashion is another passion of mine, I enjoy shopping with friends or discovering the latest trends or updates in the fashion world. Lastly, I am very much interested in geopolitics and being up to date with world news, I enjoy getting into debates regarding worldwide issues and exchanging different point of view.

     <h2>Career prospects</h2>
    <p> 
    	I still have a lot to discover about myself before I choose a specific career path. So far I enjoy the ethical side of the business world as well as economics and political governance. I would most likely want ot persue a masters degree in political governance or geopolitical issues. Nevertheless, I am also interested in working in fashion and doing a masters in Fashion management. I will have to wait and see what I enjoy the most.
